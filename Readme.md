# calc-kata

This is the draft project where you can start practicing TDD and pair-programming while building a calculator application.   

The application can execute an arithmetic expression given as a single command line argument.

You can do it your own way or try to achieve the following tasks.

## Tasks

1. When it receives no arguments returns a usage help string

1. When it receives multiple arguments returns a usage help string

1. When it receives an integer returns it as a result

1. Can execute an **addition** expression between two integers 

1. Can execute an **addition** expression between any number of integers 

1. Can execute an **addition** expression between any number of floating-point numbers

1. Can execute an **subtraction** expression between two integers 

1. Can execute an **subtraction** expression between any number of integers 

1. Can execute an **subtraction** expression between any number of floating-point numbers

1. Can execute a mixed **addition** and **subtraction** expression

1. Can execute a **multiplication** expression between two integers 

1. Can execute a **multiplication** expression between any number of integers 

1. Can execute a **multiplication** expression between any number of floating-point numbers 

1. Can execute a mixed **addition**, **subtraction** and  **multiplication** expression

You can continue the exercise adding more functions. E.g.
- division
- brackets
- ...
