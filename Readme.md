# calc-kata

This is the draft project where you can start practicing TDD and pair-programming while building a calculator application.   

The application can execute an arithmetic expression given as a single command line argument.

You can do it your own way or try to achieve the following tasks.

## Tasks

- [x] When it receives no arguments returns a usage help string

- [x]  When it receives multiple arguments returns a usage help string

- [x] When it receives an integer returns it as a result

- [x] Can execute an **addition** expression between two integers 

- [ ] Can execute an **addition** expression between any number of integers 

- [ ] Can execute an **addition** expression between any number of floating-point numbers

- [ ] Can execute an **subtraction** expression between two integers 

- [ ] Can execute an **subtraction** expression between any number of integers 

- [ ] Can execute an **subtraction** expression between any number of floating-point numbers

- [ ] Can execute a mixed **addition** and **subtraction** expression

- [ ] Can execute a **multiplication** expression between two integers 

- [ ] Can execute a **multiplication** expression between any number of integers 

- [ ] Can execute a **multiplication** expression between any number of floating-point numbers 

- [ ] Can execute a mixed **addition**, **subtraction** and  **multiplication** expression

You can continue the exercise adding more functions. E.g.
- division
- brackets
- ...
